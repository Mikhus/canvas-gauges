# HTML Canvas Gauges

[![Canvas Gauges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mikhus/blob/master/gauges.png)](https://rawgit.com/Mikhus/canv-gauge/master/examples/all-in-one.html)

This is tiny implementation of highly configurable gauge using pure JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
No need to use any library. 

## Why canvas gauge?

Because it is compatible with most modern browsers and with mobile devices.
For example, SVG, does not work on Android 2.x by default, but canvas do work.
BTW you can find your own reasons why to use canvas.
